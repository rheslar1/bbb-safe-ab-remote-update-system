# BBB Safe A/B Remote Update System Design Package

## Purpose

BeagleBone Black update project that partitions eMMC into A/B OS slots, coordinates U-Boot health checks, and uses RAUC or Mender for rollback-safe remote updates.

This design package turns the project concept into an implementation-ready engineering plan. It defines system boundaries, runtime responsibilities, interface contracts, validation evidence, and the staged path from host simulation to target hardware.

## Design Principles

- Use C++17 value types for deterministic data contracts.
- Keep target-specific APIs behind narrow adapter interfaces.
- Apply SOLID boundaries so runtime orchestration does not depend directly on hardware drivers, transport libraries, or persistence details.
- Keep host-buildable tests aligned with target behavior through scripted adapters.
- Treat diagnostics, failure modes, and validation evidence as first-class deliverables.
